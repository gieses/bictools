bictools - a python package to perform variant detection on proteomic MS data using BICEPS (Renard et al. 2012).

This repository contains a convenient KNIME workflow to perform the analysis of MS data via OpenMS and a python package (bictools) to handle results from the peptide identification from BICEPs. The combination of both utilities allows to execute the proteomic variant detection workflow.

Welcome to the bictools wiki!

This page contains all necessary information to perform a variant detection with BICEPs. However, you will require a list of software installed on your computer to run the analysis smoothly.

    KNIME with OpenMS Extension (http://www.knime.org/downloads/overview)
    python 2.7 (https://www.python.org/)

In addition you need the following python packages:
- pandas (http://www.pandas.pydata.org)
